Task contract:
- task_id: RLY-20260722-012
- role: implementation-reviewer
- agent_id: codex-implementation-reviewer-20260722T122726Z-58005
- worktree: /Users/rjxwjfl/Projects/.wt/RLY-20260722-012
- sandbox: read-only

Work only within the task packet and role boundaries. Never merge, push, alter the
control repository, or touch another worktree. Preserve unrelated changes.
For a writer, create the role-required immutable report under .outbox/. For a
read-only reviewer/challenger, do not write files; your schema-conforming final
JSON is the immutable report captured by the bridge. artifact_paths may be empty
for read-only roles. Do not include secrets in output or logs.
